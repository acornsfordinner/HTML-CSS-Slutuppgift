    <p>A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after
      the funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room, and sitting there
      by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with
      the seal of his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE, and in case of his predecease to be
      destroyed unread,” so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. “I have
      buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this should cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a
      disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as
      “not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it
      was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were
      the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from
      the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by
      the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and
      dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent
      obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe.</p>

    <p>It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth,
      Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but his
      thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance;
      perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of
      the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its
      inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more
      than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of
      spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became
      so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his
      visits.</p>

    <p>It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr. Enfield, that their way lay once again
      through the by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.</p>

    <p>“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never see more of Mr. Hyde.”</p>

    <p>“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?”</p>

    <p>“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield. “And by the way, what an ass you must have
      thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault that I found it
      out, even when I did.”</p>

    <p>“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at
      the windows. To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the presence of
      a friend might do him good.”</p>

    <p>The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead,
      was still bright with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it,
      taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.</p>

    <p>“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”</p>

    <p>“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It will not last long, thank God.”</p>

    <p>“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield
      and me. (This is my cousin--Mr. Enfield--Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick turn with us.”</p>

    <p>“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I
      dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and
      Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”</p>

    <p>“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you
      from where we are.”</p>

    <p>“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the doctor with a smile. But the words were
      hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror
      and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was
      instantly thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a word. In
      silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare,
      where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at
      his companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.</p>

    <p>“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence.</p>

    <p>Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from
      Poole.</p>

    <p>“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a second look at him, “What ails you?” he
      added; “is the doctor ill?”</p>

    <p>“Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”</p>

    <p>“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer. “Now, take your time, and tell me plainly
      what you want.”</p>
